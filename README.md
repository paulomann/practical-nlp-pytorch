# Practical NLP with PyTorch

This repository contains practical implementations of NLP models in PyTorch. They are mainly for academic purposes and learning concepts through practical examples. But, maybe it can be useful for someone.

This repository contains many functions and classes implemented in [this amazing summer school](https://github.com/dpressel/dliss-tutorial) by Daniel Pressel. However, I have organized it in a meaningful way and compiled it with some information/illustrations in the [notebooks](notebooks)
